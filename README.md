# SindyDL

This repo is an unofficial PyTorch 2.x implementation of the paper 
[Data-Driven Discovery of Coordinates and Governing Equations
](https://github.com/kpchamp/SindyAutoencoders/tree/master).

This repo is not complete yet and is being worked on continuously. The goal
of this repo is to open up the possibility of using the SINDy algorithm for
more advanced applications such as those that use computer vision and other 
 modern and exciting deep learning methods.
